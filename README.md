# Symbiosis

Preprocessor library for HTML templates, allowing template logic to be shared
between Rust, JavaScript and other languages. HTML code is parsed and
transformed into a generic language which is then fed into code generators.
This makes it possible to generate native templates independent of external
files and statically typed languages can still benefit from its type checking.

See `example` directory for simple example of how it can be used.
